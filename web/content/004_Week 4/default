<h2>4.1. History of Copyright Law </h2>

<ul>
<li>
Our basic principles are deep, technology is superficial. But it can make the very same act more or less good.
</li>
<li>Copying in the ancient world:
<ul>
<li>Slow and inefficient.</li>
<li>No economy of scale.</li>
<li>Required skills: only reading and writing.</li>
<li>Required equipment: only ''equipment'' needed to read and write.</li>
<li>Decentralized system of copying. Nothing like copyright law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Copyright and censorship were closely related throughout the history.</li>
<li>Copying in the age of printing press:
<ul>
<li>Economy of scale.</li>
<li>Special expensive equipment is required.</li>
<li>Special skills (very different from reading and writing) are needed to operate printing press.</li>
<li>Centralized system of copying. Beginning of copyright.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beginning of copyright. Copyright as a tool for industrial regulation:
<ul>
<li>Appeared in England in XVI century.</li>
<li>Started from perpetual monopoly to publish certain book. Changed in XVII century: monopoly to an author (not a publisher!) for 14 years. Could be renewed once if the author was still alive.</li>
<li>Idea of copyright: scheme which encourages writing.</li>
<li>US Constitution (1788) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause"> allows congress to create a copyright system</a> with the purpose to promote progress. Copyright can not be perpetual, only time-limited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the age of printing press copyright was used as an industry regulation tool. It regulated publishers and was controlled by authors. Copyright law was:
<ul>
<li><em>Mostly uncontroversial</em> because it restricted the publishers and not the readers. If you are not a publisher, you don't have strong reasons to object.
</li>
<li><em>Easy to enforce</em> because it was easy to understand who published certain book. No need to visit every reader to enforce the copyright law. </li>
<li><em>Beneficial for the society</em> - public traded part of its natural rights which it did not exercised to the real benefit - more books written.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.2. Copyright in the digital age</h2>
<ul>
<li>Computer networks - new advance in the technology of copying.</li>
<li>Copying became more effective and benefit of printing press in mass production almost disappeared.</li>
<li>Situation now reminds antiquity with the difference in efficiency of copying.</li>
<li>Copyright law now restricts everyone and controlled mostly by the publishers in the name of authors.</li>
<li>The reasons copyright was beneficial for society in the age of printing press are not valid anymore:
<ul>
<li><em>No more uncontroversial</em> because now it restricts everybody, not only publishers.</li>
<li><em>Not easy to enforce</em> because the copyright law shall be enforced against everyone.</li>
<li><em>No longer beneficial.</em> Public wants its natural rights back because now we are able to exercise them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changes in copyright practices:
<ul>
<li>Wave of copyright time extensions all over the world. Examples:
<ul>
<li> EU: extended copyright time for sound records and textual work.
</li>
<li>USA: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">Mickey mouse copyright act</a> (20 years extension of copyright time).</lu>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Real reasons to extend copyright time - companies had valuable rights which were about to expire.</li>
<li>We are on a way to perpetual copyright with constant extension of copyright law.</li>
<li>Mexico example: copyright validity time is 100 years after author's death.</li>
<li>Previously copyright was an exception and not a general rule. Not anymore. Publishers try to have total control over public through digital technologies (Digital Restrictions Management). </li>
<li>Attempts to take total control over public are made with non-free software - it's not possible to do this with the help of free software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.3. Digital distribution: Ethical and Unethical</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is wrong with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-call-it-the-swindle.html">Amazon ''Swindle''</a>? <li>''Swindle'' is an appropriate name for Amazon's e-reader because it swindles readers out of the traditional freedoms of readers:
<ul>
<li><em>Freedom to buy a book anonymously.</em> Amazon requires its readers to identify themselves and maintain a list with the books which were read by the user. <em> Existence of this list is dangerous for the fundamental human rights.</em> But Swindle also reports to Amazon the pages which are read, sends notes and highlights to Amazon. <em>Swindle is a complete surveillance of reading device.</em></li>
<li><em>Freedom to give a book to a friend, to sell it through used book store.</em> Swindle End User License Agreement (EULA) rejects an idea of property - the book is owned by Amazon, not by the user! ''Swindle'' DRM and EULA together swindle readers out of this right.</li>
<li><em>Freedom to keep a book as long as you wish.</em> Amazon can remotely delete books from Swindle and was doing it already ("1984" case).</li>
<li>Swindle has universal backdoor (autoupgrade, see lecture 2.2) which means additional restrictions can be installed later by Amazon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swindle is not the only malicious e-reader device: most of other e-readers are doing a lot of snooping too.</li>
<li>Requirements to be met in order for digital distribution to be ethical:
<ul>
<li> No DRM (Digital Restrictions Management).</li>
<li> No EULA - books shall be your property.</li>
<li> Possibility to purchase anonymously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currently in most cases distribution of digital copies over Internet is ethically worse than distribution of  physical copies.</li>
<li>The same problems arise with audio and video (e.g., DRM is used with streaming services).</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.4. The Why, What and How of Creative Commons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Different <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons (CC) licenses</a> give more or less freedoms:
<ul>
<li>Six main CC licenses. Two of them are free.</li>
<li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a> - push over license. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY SA</a> - copyleft license</li>
<li>Four other CC licenses are non-free. E.g., <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">NC license</a> restricts commercial usage and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">ND license</a> restricts modification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which CC license to use for the project?
<ul>
<li>For statements of opinion, artistic works non-free licenses are OK.</li>
<li>If the works shall be free (e.g., practical work, reference, educational) - use one of two free CC licenses.</li>
<li>License choice is crucial - don't delay this decision until the end of the project. Agree with project team in the very beginning!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>''This work is distributed under CC license'' - confusing statement. <em>Which</em> CC license? It makes a lot of difference.</li>
<li>Never distribute software under CC license! See lecture 3 for software licenses information.</li>
</ul>
