This course would not exist without support of certain people and organizations.

=== Companies ===

- [Eliademy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliademy] made a huge technical and organizational contribution. It would not be possible to make video recordings without their assistance with equipment
and travel arrangements.


=== Individuals ===

- [Richard M. Stallman http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman], Founder of FSF. It is 100% clear that this course would not exist without him and his very active and professional contribution.
- [Tuomo Ryyn√§nen http://piraattipuolue.fi/tuomo-ryynanen] A lot of thanks to Tuomo and his family for providing a space for filming the videos and their warm and patient attitude to the restless guests.
- Pasi Husso for helping with producing videos, creating most of the slides and music theme for the course.

=== Spreading the world about this course ===

More people are aware of this course, more chances they will take it and will become educated in the subject this course is dedicated to - Free Digital Society.
We need your help in order to spread the information about this course!


=== Bringing this course to the new platforms ===

The course content is licensed under Creative Commons license and can be freely redistributed (even for commercial purposes. Because freedom is not about price at all).
