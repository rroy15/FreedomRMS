<h2>2.1. Digital Society: Inclusion or Escape? Surveillance, censorship, restricting the users</h2>

<ul>
<li>Shall we aim for inclusion to or escape from the Digital Society?</li>
<li>What are the threats to the Digital Society? Overview.</li>
<li>Threat 1: Surveillance.
<ul>
<li>Surveillance and Democracy: how are they compatible?</li>
<li>Who watches the watchmen? Why society needs whistleblowers.</li>
<li>Common engineering practice of the day: keep all the data you can.</li>
<li>Three ways to spy on people. Examples and the ways to react: </li>
<ol>
<li>Through their own systems.</li>
<li>Through the systems they use but don't own (e.g., phone networks).</li>
<li>Surveillance systems which are designed specifically for this activity.</li>
</ol>
<li>Data from business surveillance systems is available to the state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Threat 2: Censorship.
<ul>
<li>Censorship in Internet: "filtration".</li>
<li>Country examples (Europe, Asia, ...).</li>
<li>Propaganda methods: using disgusting things (e.g., child pornography) to advocate censorship tools.
</ul>
</li>
<li>Threat 3: Data formats that restrict their users.
<ul>
<li>Digital handcuffs.</li>
<li>DRM: Digital Restrictions Management.</li>
<li>Reasons why secret data formats exist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.2. Threats from software that the user do not control</h2>

<ul>
<li>There are only two options: the users controls the program OR the program controls the users.</li>
<li>Backdoors and Universal Backdoors.</li>
<li>Real-life examples: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-call-it-the-swindle.html">Amazon Swindle</a>, portable phones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.3. Threats from Service as a Software Substitute</h2>

<ul>
<LI>SaaSS: new way to lose control over your computing.</LI>
<li>SaaSS: how it works. Technical explanation. </li>
<li>SaaSS is equivalent to running non-free program with universal backdoor which makes it proprietary malware.</li>
<li>Paradoxical relationships between SaaSS and free/nonfree software.
<ul>
<li>
If server software is free, it does not help the users. It benefits only the server owner.
</li>
<li>If server software is non-free then server owner does not control it. Somebody else controls it. The users do not benefit in either of the situations.
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not all the services are SaaSS:
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you can't fully control your computing - e.g., when you are communicating with other people.</li>
<li>If  your task can be done if you have powerful computer and required software, then server-based solution is SaaSS. Otherwise it is not.
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples of SaaSS: Translation and Speech Recognition services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.4. War on Sharing. Precarity</h2>

<ul>
<li>What is sharing and why it is good.</li>
<li>Attack on sharing is an attack on social cooperation.</li>
<li>Two kinds of works:
<ol>
<li>Works we need to do practical jobs (e.g. reference works, educational works): should be free. </li>
<li>Others (e.g. entertainment, opinion, art) should be freely shareable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Ways to attack sharing:
<ul>
<li>Laws which forbid sharing. </li>
<li>Propaganda. Terms like "Piracy" and "Theft":
<ul>
<li>Reject propaganda terms! Attacking ship is very bad, sharing is good.</li>
<li>Legally speaking, copyright infringement is never theft. Sometimes it's a crime, sometimes not. But is it NEVER a theft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Publishing of the works using secret formats with the purpose to restrict the public:
<ul>
<li>DVD "conspiracy": if you want to manufacture DVD player, you need to join the conspiracy. No competition in this important part of DVD player functionality!
</ul>
</li>
<li> DMCA: Digital Millennium Copyright Act:
<ul>
<li> Banning distribution of free software which allows to read DVDs in the secret format.</li>
<li> Similar laws in EU and other countries.
</ul>
</li>
<li>DRM: Digital Restrictions Management:
<ul>
<li>Introduced by AACS (Advanced Access Content System) "conspiracy".</li>
<li>Example of AACS power: they managed to ban analog video outputs.</li>
</ul>
<li>Disconnect people from Internet when they are <i>accused</i> of sharing (without a trial):
<ul>
<li>Crashing of the basic principle of justice - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial">No punishment without a trial</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Controlling what our technology does is a worse attack on society than controlling prices. It shall be treated as more grave crime.</li>
<li>Usage of Internet is precarious:
<ul>
<li>You need to cooperate with ISP, DNS registrar, other companies in order to do your tasks.</li>
<li>Typically the contracts you sign are so, that they can be canceled for any reason by service provider. </li>
<li>Example: Dirty Tricks campaign against WikiLeaks. </li>
<li>Analogy: imagine that government convinces your phone or electrical company that it's in their interest to stop serving you.</li>
<li>Regulation is needed like for other public utilities: no right to disconnect if I pay according to the contract, no way to discriminate single customer etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
